## Key differences between SQL and DynamoDB when reading data from a table

With SQL, you use the `SELECT` statement to retrieve one or more rows from a table. You use the `WHERE` clause to determine the data that is returned to you.

This is different than using Amazon DynamoDB which provides the following operations for reading data:

- `ExecuteStatement` retrieves a single or multiple items from a table. `BatchExecuteStatement` retrieves multiple items from different tables in a single operation. Both of these operations use [PartiQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ql-reference.html), a SQL-compatible query language.
   
- `GetItem` – Retrieves a single item from a table. This is the most efficient way to read a single item because it provides direct access to the physical location of the item. (DynamoDB also provides the `BatchGetItem` operation, allowing you to perform up to 100 `GetItem` calls in a single operation.)
   
- `Query` – Retrieves all of the items that have a specific partition key. Within those items, you can apply a condition to the sort key and retrieve only a subset of the data. `Query` provides quick, efficient access to the partitions where the data is stored. (For more information, see [Partitions and data distribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.Partitions.html).)

- `Scan` – Retrieves all of the items in the specified table. (This operation should not be used with large tables because it can consume large amounts of system resources.)
