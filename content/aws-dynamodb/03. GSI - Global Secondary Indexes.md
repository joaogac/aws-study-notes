A primary key in DynamoDB consists of two attributes: partition key + sort key. 

<span style="background:#d3f8b6">Partition key</span> -> determines the specific partition (internal physical storage) where the item is stored. Items within the same partition are sorted by the sort key values.

<span style="background:#d3f8b6">Sort key</span> -> (a.k.a. range key) determines the order in which items are stored within the same partition. 


<span style="background:#d3f8b6">Scans</span> -> needs to <u>read all the items in the table before returning</u> the matching items. Consuming significantly amounts of RCUs.

> You can use the `Scan` operation to retrieve all of the data from a global secondary index. You must provide the base table name and the index name in the request. ==With a `Scan`, DynamoDB reads all of the data in the index and returns it to the application. You can also request that only some of the data be returned, and that the remaining data should be discarded==. To do this, use the `FilterExpression` parameter of the `Scan` operation.

```bash
aws dynamodb scan \
     --table-name Thread \
     --filter-expression "LastPostedBy = :name" \
     --expression-attribute-values '{":name":{"S":"User A"}}'
```


<span style="background:#d3f8b6">Conditions</span> -> optimizes query efficiency (by combining with sort keys) returning only the data you need. Strategically <span style="background:#fff88f">design your data model tailoring your queries access patterns</span>. 

> You can use the `Query` API operation in Amazon DynamoDB to find items based on primary key values.
> 
> You must provide the name of the partition key attribute and a single value for that attribute. `Query` returns all items with that partition key value. Optionally, you can provide a sort key attribute and use a comparison operator to refine the search results.

The following AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) examples demonstrate the use of key condition expressions. These expressions use placeholders (such as `:name` and `:sub`) instead of actual values.

```bash
aws dynamodb query \
    --table-name Thread \
    --key-condition-expression "ForumName = :name" \
    --expression-attribute-values  '{":name":{"S":"Amazon DynamoDB"}}'
```

Query the `Thread` table for a particular `ForumName` (partition key), but this time return only the items with a given `Subject` (sort key).

```bash
aws dynamodb query \
    --table-name Thread \
    --key-condition-expression "ForumName = :name and Subject = :sub" \
    --expression-attribute-values  file://values.json
```
`values.json`
```json
{
    ":name": {"S":"Amazon DynamoDB"},
    ":sub": {"S":"DynamoDB Thread 1"}
}
```

### Sensor queries

#### Base table
For a given device, find the last readings
#### Has to be GSI
For an error status, find the readings with that status
#### Can be an LSI or GSI
For a given device, find its errors

Implemented as secondary tables

![[Global Secondary Indexes-20240615171805382.webp]]

Changes need to be propagated to the GSIs
* Does it increases WCUs ? 
	* No! It provides a separate capacity

Consumes from the base tables
* Creates a hot partition on that table, everything is still going to that same tables

Maximum 400KB size per item in LSIs
* Item + LSIs

Strong consistent reads -> advantage for LSIs above GSIs

### Data synchronization between tables and Global Secondary Indexes

When you put or delete items in a table, the global secondary indexes on that table are updated in an eventually consistent fashion. Changes to the table data are propagated to the global secondary indexes within a fraction of a second, under normal conditions. However, in some unlikely failure scenarios, longer propagation delays might occur. Because of this, your applications need to anticipate and handle situations where a query on a global secondary index returns results that are not up to date.


### Use indexes efficiently

==Keep the number of indexes to a minimum. Don't create secondary indexes on attributes that you don't query often.== Indexes that are seldom used contribute to increased storage and I/O costs without improving application performance.


### Cost considerations

When utilizing a global secondary index (GSI) in DynamoDB, factors like <span style="background:#fff88f">attribute projection, storage, and throughput affect costs</span>. The choice of attribute projection is a crucial consideration.  

- Using <u>INCLUDE</u> projection allows for selecting a subset of attributes to be included in the index, thereby reducing storage costs. 

- Conversely, <u>ALL</u> projection includes all attributes in the index, simplifying querying but significantly increasing both storage and throughput costs. 

Striking a balance between cost optimization and functionality is vital, and it requires careful evaluation of the projected attributes’ importance, the frequency of their access, and the available budget.

#### [Attribute projections](https://dev.to/manojlingala/maximizing-efficiency-in-dynamodb-the-power-of-projections-2bl7)

A _projection_ is the set of attributes that is copied from a table into a secondary index. The partition key and sort key of the table are always projected into the index; you can project other attributes to support your application's query requirements. When you query an index, Amazon DynamoDB can access any attribute in the projection as if those attributes were in a table of their own.

When you create a secondary index, you need to specify the attributes that will be projected into the index. DynamoDB provides three different options for this:

- _KEYS_ONLY_ – Each item in the index consists only of the table partition key and sort key values, plus the index key values. The `KEYS_ONLY` option results in the smallest possible secondary index.

- _INCLUDE_ – In addition to the attributes described in `KEYS_ONLY`, the secondary index will include other non-key attributes that you specify.
   
- _ALL_ – The secondary index includes all of the attributes from the source table. Because all of the table data is duplicated in the index, an `ALL` projection results in the largest possible secondary index.

#### Storage considerations for Global Secondary Indexes

When an application writes an item to a table, DynamoDB automatically copies the correct subset of attributes to any global secondary indexes in which those attributes should appear. <span style="background:#fff88f">Your AWS account is charged for storage of the item in the base table and also for storage of attributes in any global secondary indexes on that table</span>.

The amount of space used by an index item is the sum of the following:

- The size in bytes of the base table primary key (partition key and sort key)
- The size in bytes of the index key attribute
- The size in bytes of the projected attributes (if any)
- 100 bytes of overhead per index item

To estimate the storage requirements for a global secondary index, you can estimate the average size of an item in the index and then multiply by the number of items in the base table that have the global secondary index key attributes.
